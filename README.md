# Storm

Storm is an experimental Minecraft modpack focused on delivering an outstanding performance and enhancing the quality-of-life without adding any new content to the base Minecraft experience. Currently, Stormed is released for Minecraft version 1.20.1 on the Fabric loader, but the compatibility will be extended to Quilt and older Minecraft versions in the future.

## :warning:

Please note that **Storm is currently in alpha** and it may be unstable.

## Installation

You can obtain the Storm modpack in the form of a .mrpack file from the [Releases tab](https://github.com/TheBossMagnus/Storm/releases). To install the modpack, you'll need a launcher that supports .mrpack files, such as Prism or MultiMc. Alternatively, you can utilize the tool [Superpack](https://github.com/Gaming32/Superpack) to install Storm.

## Coming Soon

I am actively working on improving Storm and plan to release it on Modrinth for the beta phase soon. Keep an eye on this repository for updates and news about the modpack's progress.
